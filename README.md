History
=======
 
The initial designing was done on Webador, but after sorting out the basic design Webador wanted lots of money to make the site live.  I lifted the resultant HTML code and have been editing the code itself to polish it off.  The benefit of using their code is that the site can cope with a variety of browsers, from desktops to mobile phones.  The downside is that it makes the code complicated to understand when changing the layout. 
 
I had a go at writing HTML code a few years ago so I understand the weird way that HTML is written, and this has certainly been a learning exercise!  
 
I am using Github for hosting the website, the downside is that I have to change the code to make changes (I can’t just move stuff around a screen), the upside is that it is totally £free, and will always be free.  I have set it up so that if I want to change the pictures, I just have to make sure that they are roughly the right size and copy them onto Github.  Changing text is equally easy.
 
At the moment HTTP:// works but the usual HTTPS:// name doesn’t (the difference is that the HTTPS is more secure, and needs a SSL security certificate). 
 
ChatGPT is great, I asked it about where to get my code hosted for free, and it recommended Github, and then it asked if I wanted a guide on how to set it up? (I could not have done it without the guide). When I had the problem that pictures showed on my desktop, but only half showed on the website, ChatGPT explained where I had gone wrong. I would not call any of the processes intuitive!
 
Thoughts:
The text is a bit small for phones, I haven’t worked out how to make the default font any larger, if you follow the Directions Link on the top menu the text on that page is larger.
The menu options at the top only take you to places on the page, not other pages (except for directions)
I have found some more very old pictures, we need to take some new ones when we restart
Is there anything else we can add to the site?  I only foresee using it as a reference for people who are thinking of joining us, and not as a newsletter (WhatsApp), so the pages will be very static.
The Banner saying we are closed will be changed on the 2nd September
